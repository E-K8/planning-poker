# Planning poker

This is a little app inspired by processes at work. I wanted to create a simple and straightforward tool of my own.

It's not finished yet, I'm making it public for deployment purposes.

Frontend: Next JS, deployed on Vercel, backend: Node JS, deployed on Render. Free tier for both, so it may work inconsistently. I'd start backend first to check that it definitely runs, and frontend after that.

[Palette](https://coolors.co/visualizer/ef476f-ffd166-06d6a0-118ab2-073b4c) chosen in the beginning:
#073b4c,
#118ab2,
#06d6a0,
#ffd166,
#ef476f.

I'm keeping these on the page for some colour. The app is unstyled yet.

### To run locally:

#### Start backend

    cd ppoker/backend
    npm i
    npm start

#### Start frontend

    cd ppoker
    npm i
    npm start
